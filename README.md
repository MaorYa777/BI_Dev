Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and machine learning, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and model training using a Random Forest Classifier.

Running the Notebook

To ensure correct execution, please follow the steps in the specified order:

Import DataLoad the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

PreprocessingPerform data cleaning, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.

InputingHandle missing values using imputation techniques.

Data EnrichmentAdd additional derived features to enhance model performance.

EDA and Plots Based on Categorical and Numeric ColumnsAnalyze and visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

Imbalanced Data MethodApply techniques to handle class imbalance, such as SMOTE or undersampling.

Model: Random Forest ClassifierTrain and evaluate a Random Forest model on the processed dataset.

Feature ImportanceAnalyze feature contributions to the modelâ€™s predictions.

Visualizations

All visualizations related to the dataset, EDA, and model evaluation are located at the bottom of the notebook.
